This paper uses output from a three-dimensional numerical model to demonstrate that HV in Chesapeake Bay can be estimated well with as few as two vertical profiles. In addition, the cumulative hypoxic volume (HVC), i.e. the total amount of hypoxia in a given year, can be calculated with relatively low uncertainty (<10%) if continuous DO data are available from two strategically positioned vertical profiles. This is because HV in the Chesapeake Bay is strongly constrained by the geometry of the embayment. A simple Geometric HV calculation method is presented, and numerical model results are used to illustrate that for calculating HVC, the results using two daily-averaged profiles are typically more accurate than those of the standard method that interpolates bimonthly cruise data. Bimonthly data produce less accurate estimates of HVC because high frequency changes in oxygen concentration, for example due to regional-weather or storm-induced changes in wind direction and magnitude, are not resolved. The advantages of using continuous vertical profile data to estimate HVC should be applicable to other systems where hypoxic water is constrained to a specific area by bathymetry. The datasets below include the station file output from the Regional Ocean Modeling System Simple Respiration Model (ROMS-SRM) used in the analysis, as well as a MATLAB .mat file of the 3-D HV from the average files.</p><p><b>Collaborators: </b>Aaron Bever, Marjorie Friedrichs, Carl Friedrichs, Malcolm Scully</p><p><b>Publications: </b></p><a href=\"https://www.biogeosciences.net/13/2011/2016/\" target=\"_blank\">Bever, A.J., M.A.M.

Despite the simplicity of the approach, the model demonstrates skill in simulating the observed inter-annual variability of hypoxic volume capturing 50% of the observed variability in hypoxic volume (< 2 mg/L) for the month of July and 58% of the observed variability for the month of August, over the 30-year period.  Model skill increases throughout the summer suggesting that physical processes play a more important role in modulating hypoxia later in the summer.  Model skill is better for hypoxic volumes than for anoxic volumes.  In fact, a simple regression based on the integrated January—June Susquehanna River nitrogen load can explain more of the variability in the observed anoxic volumes than the 1-term model.  Model results suggest that the mean summer (June-August) wind speed is the single-most important physical variable contributing to variations in hypoxic volumes.</p><p><b>Collaborators: </b>Malcolm Scully</p><p><b>Publications: </b></p><p>Scully, M.E., 2016.

Although the mean nitrogen budget of the Chesapeake Bay has been previously estimated from observations, uncertainties associated with interannually varying hydrological conditions remain. In this study, a land-estuarine-ocean biogeochemical modeling system is developed to quantify Chesapeake riverine nitrogen inputs, within-estuary nitrogen transformation processes and the ultimate export of nitrogen to the coastal ocean. Model skill was evaluated using extensive in situ and satellite-derived data, and a simulation using environmental conditions for 2001–2005 was conducted to quantify the Chesapeake Bay nitrogen budget. The five year simulation was characterized by large riverine inputs of nitrogen split roughly 60:40 between inorganic:organic components. Much of this was denitrified and buried within the estuarine system. A positive net annual ecosystemproduction for the bay further contributed to a large advective export of organic nitrogen to the shelf and negligible inorganic nitrogen export. Interannual variability was strong, particularly for the riverine nitrogen fluxes. In years with higher than average riverine nitrogen  inputs, most of this excess nitrogen (50–60%) was exported from the bay as organic nitrogen, with the remaining split between burial, denitrification, and inorganic export to the coastal ocean. In comparison to previous simulations using generic shelf biogeochemical model formulations inside the estuary, the estuarine biogeochemical model described here produced more realistic and significantly greater exports of organic nitrogen and lower exports of inorganic nitrogen to the shelf.</p><p><b>Collaborators:</b></p><p><b>Publications:</b></p><p><b>Datasets:</b><div class=\"list-group\"></div></p></div>",
            "model_desc": "<h3>Primary Chesapeake Bay Testbed models:</h3><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">ChesROMS-SRM, ChesROMS -ECB, ChesROMS-BGC</h4><p>ChesROMS (<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12237-011-9423-5\" target=\"_blank\">Xu et al. 2012</a>) is a community ocean modeling system for the Chesapeake Bay region, which is based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (<a href=\"http://www.myroms.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ROMS</a>), with significant adaptations for the Chesapeake Bay. The model uses a curvilinear horizontal grid and a stretched terrain-following vertical grid with twenty vertical layers. The model was developed to provide a community modeling system for hindcasts, nowcasts and forecasts of 3D hydrodynamic circulation, temperature and salinity.</p><p>Multiple ecosystem/biogeochemical models have been coupled with ChesROMS. These include the Simple Respiration Model (SRM) which uses a constant respiration rate throughout the water column, as well as more sophisticated biogeochemical including including <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JG002931/epdf\" target=\"_blank\">ChesROMS-ECB</a> and ChesROMS-BGC (see <a href=\"http://www.biogeosciences.net/13/2011/2016/\" target=\"blank\">Irby et al. 2016</a> for descriptions of these models.)</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">CBOFS-SRM</h4><p>The ROMS-based Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System (CBOFS; Lanerolle et al., 2011) is the operational model run by the NOAA National Ocean Service. A major difference between ChesROMS and CBOFS is the horizontal grid resolution; ChesROMS has 100x150 cells with about 1 to 7 km resolution; CBOFS has 332x291 cells with about 0.03 to 4 km resolution. Results from CBOFS are available at: <a href=\"https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html</a>. The Simple Respiration Model (SRM) has recently been coupled with CBOFS; these results are only available on a developmental version of the official CBOFS website.</p><h3>Additional Chesapeake Bay models:</h3><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">ROMS-RCA</h4><p>Another ROMS-based model for the Chesapeake Bay has been independently developed and coupled to the Row-Column AESOP model (RCA; Testa et al., 2014). This version of ROMS (Li et al. 2005) is very similar to ChesROMS (including a similar horizontal resolution and number of vertical grid levels), but has slightly different hydrodynamic parameterizations and physical forcing.</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">CH3D-ICM</h4><p>The Curvilinear Hydrodynamics in Three Dimensions model (CH3D; Cerco et al., 2010), is compared with the ChesROMS models described above in Irby et al. (2016). This model employs a z-grid and is used by the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program as part of their regulatory operational modeling framework. The horizontal grid of CH3D-ICM has significantly greater resolution than ChesROMS, and is more equivalent to that of CBOFS. CH3D is coupled to the Integrated Compartment Model (ICM), which is a complex biogeochemical modeling system.</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">EFDC-SRM</h4><p>The Hydrodynamic-Eutrophication Model – Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) has been implemented for the Chesapeake Bay (Hong and Shen, 2012; Du and Shen, 2015), and also participated in the Chesapeake Bay Hypoxia Testbed comparison (Irby et al. 2016). The EFDC implementation used here is coupled to a version of the Simple Respiration Model (SRM).</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">FVCOM-ICM</h4><p>The ChesROMS models were also compared with the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM; Jiang and Xia, 2015). FVCOM employs an unstructured grid with ten vertical layers. Like CH3D, FVCOM is coupled to the ICM.</p>",

                "text": "<p>Hypoxia is a condition threatening the health of the Chesapeake Bay in which oxygen levels drop so low that fish and other animals are stressed or killed.  In the Bay, incidents of hypoxia-causing ‘dead zones’ are on the rise.</p><p>Hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay usually occurs in the summer and is primarily the result of human activities that deliver nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the Bay, although evidence from the testbed scientists suggest that wind forcing also plays a significant role. The added nutrients support surface blooms of algae, which eventually die, sink and are decomposed at the bottom of the Bay by oxygen-depleting bacteria. The resulting hypoxia can suffocate animals that cannot move away, such as shellfish, and — depending on how quickly the hypoxia develops — either kill or force into less suitable habitat free-swimming animals such as fish and crabs.</p><p>The Chesapeake Bay Testbed project is designed to provide a better understanding of the uncertainty inherent in predictions of properties such as salinity, temperature, chlorophyll, and nutrients; how this uncertainty contributes to the predictability of dissolved oxygen concentrations; and how to improve models of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the Chesapeake Bay. Model intercomparisons have demonstrated that the regulatory model used by the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program performs as well as many of the research models currently being used by the scientific community, giving both Chesapeake Bay Program Managers and academic scientists more confidence in the regulatory model. An ensemble mean of multiple models was found to have higher skill predicting hypoxia than any individual model (<a href=\"http://www.biogeosciences.net/13/2011/2016/\" target=\"_blank\">Irby et al., 2016</a>), illustrating the potential value of multi-model ensembles for decision making in the Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>A simple one-term model for hypoxia was developed for use in operational forecasts and is currently providing nowcasts and 2-day forecasts of Chesapeake Bay hypoxia on the <a href=\"http://www.vims.edu/research/topics/dead_zones/forecasts/cbay/\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Institute of Marine Science website</a>. Forecasts from more sophisticated hypoxia models are in the developmental stage and will soon also be available on this website, along with other fields relevant to Chesapeake stakeholders (temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, water clarity). Efforts to transition this tool to NOAA’s <a href=\"https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System (CBOFS)</a> and to the <a href=\"http://oceansmap.maracoos.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IOOS Mid-Atlantic Regional Association (MARACOOS) OceansMap</a> are ongoing. In a companion effort, the Chesapeake Hypoxia Testbed team has used multiple models to examine how nutrient load reductions will impact dissolved oxygen in the Chesapeake Bay, and has developed a method for quantifying the uncertainty associated with projected changes in hypoxia resulting from the implementation of these nutrient reductions. Ongoing work is focused on applying projected changes in temperature, freshwater flow, and sea level rise for a 2050 scenario to explore the impact climate change may have on future Chesapeake Bay hypoxia and the potential success of the nutrient reductions in attaining mandated estuarine water quality standards.</p><p>The results of this project are providing the modeling information that will enable best management practices and mitigation measures to be targeted on the human activities that have the most significant effect on decreasing nutrient transfer from land to coastal ecosystems in the region. Recent findings include (1) that the ChesROMS-1term model performs just as well when using nowcast forcing as it does when using hindcast forcing, (2) that ignoring precipitation/evaporation and underestimating riverine freshwater inputs may be causing a high salinity bias in the official version of CBOFS, (3) that nutrient load reduction scenarios conducted with both the regulatory EPA model and our ChesROMS-BGC research model confirm that both models predict similar improvements in bottom DO, and nearly identical water quality standards attainment, (4) the transition of the HYPOXIA_SRM (simple respiration model) to the official ROMS Ecosystem Branch.

The formation is due to decay of organic matter that is primarily derived from nutrient inputs from the Mississippi/Atchafalaya river system. Efforts are underway to reduce the extent of hypoxic conditions through nutrient management in the watershed; for example, the interagency <a href='https://www.epa.gov/ms-htf' target='_blank'>Hypoxia Task Force</a> is developing Action Plans with input from various stakeholders that set out targets for hypoxia reduction. In order to improve mechanistic understanding of hypoxia formation and to inform nutrient management decisions, several coupled circulation-hypoxia models are being developed for the Mississippi River outflow region.</p><p>This COMT project conducts an inter-comparison of these hypoxia models and uses scenario simulations to assess the impact of potential reductions in nutrient load and of climate change on hypoxia formation. Understanding how and why model predictions differ will ultimately lead to improved model formulations, improved hindcasts and forecasts, and improved mechanistic understanding. The study is focusing on identifying factors that influence the prediction of dissolved oxygen concentration both to improve our understanding of the controlling processes and to provide guidance on the eventual implementation of dissolved oxygen forecasts in NOAA’s Northern Gulf of Mexico Operational Forecast System (NGOFS).</p><video class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' controls='controls'><source src='http://memg.ocean.dal.ca/fennelk/wip/COMT_2016_hindcast/movies/CrossSec_3d_ROMS_NARR_2015.mp4' type='video/mp4'></video><p class='caption'>Simulated surface salinity and bottom water oxygen concentration in 2015 in the small ROMS domain.</p><video class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' controls='controls'><source src='http://memg.ocean.dal.ca/fennelk/wip/COMT_2016_hindcast/movies/CrossSec_3d_ROMS_NARR_2016.mp4' type='video/mp4'></video><p class='caption'>Simulated surface salinity and bottom water oxygen concentration in 2016 in the small ROMS domain.</p>"

Summer 2009. No data assimilation. Hourly model outputs.</p><h3>A coupled physical/biogeochemical WCOFS model test</h3><p>Three NPZ-type, lower trophic level, biogeochemical models were evaluated and compared as part of this project. (1) The Cascadia model is a six-component model including nutrients, phytoplankton, microzooplankton, slow- and fast-sinking detritus, and oxygen.  It has been developed and parameterized specifically for Washington-Oregon coastal waters, and is run in near real-time at the University of Washington.  (2) The UCSC version of NEMURO (derived from Kishi et al. 2007) includes eleven state variables: nitrate, ammonium, small and large phytoplankton biomass, small, large and predatory zooplankton biomass, particulate and dissolved organic nitrogen, particulate silica, and silicic acid concentration.  NEMURO has been used for years in the regional domain and is run at UCSC in near real-time with data assimilation in support of CeNCOOS.   (3) The CoSiNE model (Chai et al., 2002) is a 9-component model, representing the evolution of two phytoplankton groups, two size classes of zooplankton, two types of detritus, ammonium, nitrate, and silicate.  It has been widely applied to a variety of regions including the tropical Pacific ocean and California current system.</p><p>For the biogeochemical comparison, a 1-year integration was carried out for the year 2000.  Model fields were evaluated by calculating model data misfit to instantaneous surface chlorophyll data from the SeaWiFS platform and deviations from climatological nutrients after spatially and temporally averaging model output over three-month, 1-degree square regions.  Models were evaluated both using base parameters tuned for alternate applications and parameters optimized for this physical implementation resulting from a Monte Carlo tuning procedure (Mattern and Edwards, 2017).  Overall, all three models performed well in the UCSC domain with good agreement with data.  Phytoplankton growth rates and zooplankton grazing rates for each model spanned ranges for these rate processes calculated in along the Oregon and Washington coasts (Banas et al., 2008).  Cascadia was the most computationally efficient model with the fewest state variables.  The model having lowest cost function (least model-data misfit) was the most complex model investigated, NEMURO.</p><p>Based on results of the multi-model evaluation in the regional CCS domain, the NEMURO model was ported to the 4 km WCOFS domain and integrated as a test-case from October 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013.  Model output was evaluated against satellite-derived surface chlorophyll and climatological nitrate and silicate over the spring/summer period of 2013.  The model performs well, revealing good quantifiable agreement with observations in terms of mean quantities and temporal evolution.  Model results from this experiment, along with all necessary forcing files, are posted here as a baseline against which future results can be compared and improvements established.</p><p><b>References: </b></p><p>Banas NS, Lessard E, Kudela R, MacCready P, Peterson T, Hickey BM, Frame E (2009) Planktonic growth and grazing in the Columbia River plume region: A biophysical model study.

It provides daily updates of 3-day forecasts of oceanic currents, temperature, salinity and total sea level. The system operation is part of the NANOOS Regional Association activities and forecasts are delivered to the public at http://nvs.nanoos.org. The model resolution is 2-km in horizontal. The domain extends in the alongshore direction from 40.5 to 50N. The model dynamics are based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS, myroms.org). The initial conditions for the forecasts are constrained by assimilation of alongtrack altimetry, satellite SST, and HF radar surface currents. Data assimilation uses the 4DVAR method in a series of 3-day windows. To enable 4DVAR, the nonlinear ROMS is integrated with the AVRORA tangent linear and adjoint system (Kurapov et al., JGR, 2011).</p><p>Over the years, S. Erofeeva, P. Yu, I. Pasmans and A.

The model <a href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/LiveOcean.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/LiveOcean.html</a> creates a three-day forecast every day for the region shown in Fig. 1.  The model domain covers 43 to 50 N and -127.4 to -122 W.  The LiveOcean output database contains continuous hourly fields starting January 1, 2013 and going to the present.  Recent fields, including biogeochemical properties on multiple levels, are available publicly through the NANOOS NVS website <a href=\"http://nvs.nanoos.org/Explorer?action=overlay:liveocean_temp</\" target=\"_blank\">http://nvs.nanoos.org/Explorer?action=overlay:liveocean_temp</a> and the IOOS EDS Model Viewer <a href=\"https://eds.ioos.us/\" target=\"_blank\">https://eds.ioos.us/.</a></p><p>The modeling framework employs the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS http://myroms.org/) a free surface, hydrostatic, primitive equation model.  The model is forced with realistic atmospheric, tide, river, and ocean boundary conditions to simulate the 3D circulation and water properties throughout the domain.  The model includes 16 river point sources using daily measured and forecast discharge including 14 Puget Sound rivers, the Fraser River, and the Columbia River.  Eight tidal constituents derived from the 1/4° TPXO7.2 inverse global tidal model are forced at the open boundaries. Meteorological forcing of surface pressure, wind, air temperature, relative humidity, shortwave radiation, downward longwave radiation, and rainfall are taken from a WRF regional forecast model with 12 km resolution run by Dr. Cliff Mass at University of Washington. Open ocean boundary conditions for daily-averaged velocity, salinity, temperature and sea surface height come from the HYCOM global model (<a href=\"http://hycom.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://hycom.org/</a>). The river, atmosphere and ocean forcing models are data-assimilative and so do an excellent job of keeping their forecast fields close to observations.  The grid horizontal resolution is 1.5 km on the shelf, and 4.5 km far offshore.  There are 40 vertical levels, distributed from the sea floor to the sea surface, giving excellent resolution of both bottom and near-surface processes.  The large domain allows important interactions between the inland and coastal waters, for example the influence of coastal upwelling and the Columbia River plume on the inflow to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which in turn sets many of the water properties in Puget Sound.</p><p>This model was developed in the recent NOAA-funded PNWTOX project (Dr. Barbara Hickey, PI) to study Pseudo-nitzschia harmful algal blooms (HABs).  Hindcast experiments from 2004-2007 were extensively validated in terms of currents, temperature, salinity, sea surface height, and biogeochemistry (Giddings et al. 2014; Davis et al. 2014; Siedlecki et al. 2015).  The model exhibited significant skill in all regions on the shelf.  Most recently it has been used in a study of the Strait of Juan de Fuca (Giddings and MacCready 2017) where it was successfully able to reproduce the flow reversals there which are caused by downwelling-favorable winds and the Columbia River plume.  Over the past three years, with funding from the Washington Ocean Acidification Center, the model framework was transitioned from being a hindcast model to its current version as a daily forecast model.  The model is currently used as part of the NOAA MERHAB-PNW project to provide early warning of the arrival of HABs at the Washington coast.</p><p>Model development team: Parker MacCready (UW), Ryan McCabe (UW), Samantha Siedlecki (U.

The ocean circulation is modeled using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). Our domain extends from midway down the Baja Peninsula to 48 N, near the southern tip of Vancouver Island, at 1/10 degree (roughly 10 km) resolution, with 42 terrain-following levels resolving vertical structure in ocean properties. The model is forced at the surface by atmospheric fields produced by the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) which is run in near-real-time by the Naval Research Laboratory. Oceanic fields at the lateral boundaries are obtained from a larger, basin-scale data assimilative model, HYCOM. The model does not include freshwater forcing by rivers, and it neglects tidal motion.</p><p>This model has provided the baseline configuration for many studies of ocean dynamics (Veneziani et al. 2009b), biogeochemical interactions (Goebel et al. 2010), larval dispersal (Drake et al., 2011), and physical data assimilation (Broquet et al., 2010, Moore et al., 2013, Neveu et al., 2016), and coupled biophysical data assimilation (Song et al. 2016, Mattern et al. 2017).   </p><p>The UCSC ocean data assimilation methodology uses the ROMS 4-Dimensional Variational assimilation system (Moore et al., 2011).  Satellite-derived sea surface height, sea surface temperature, and sea surface salinity are assimilated when available, along with in-situ hydrography from a variety of sources (e.g., shipboard casts, gliders, and \nArgo profiles).  Sequences of 8-day analyses of the California Current System from 1980 to 2010 and 1999 to 2011 have been calculated, and a near real-time product has been running fairly routinely from 2011 to the present.  A near real-time, coupled physical biogeochemical model has also been running since 2014, using 4-day cycles and assimilating satellite-derived chlorophyll estimates.</p><p>Considerably more information about the model and its output can be found at <a href=\"http://oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu\" target=\"_blank\">http://oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu.</a></p><p><b>References: </b></p><p>Broquet, G., A.

Broad project objectives are to: (1) compile a data set of observations collected around Puerto Rico and the USVI by the IOOS Caribbean Regional Association; (2) evaluate multiple, coupled wave/surge/inundation models against this data; (3) recommend the most suitable model for transition to operations and (4) assist with the transition. These outcomes will also be applicable to U.S. island regions in the Pacific and may therefore guide future implementations at NOAA’s Central Pacific Hurricane Center.</p><p>U.S. island regions in the Caribbean and Pacific pose many challenges to the accurate modeling and prediction of hazardous wave-dominated storm surge inundation events. The relative importance of physical processes leading to inundation in steep-sloped, reef-edged island environments differs from those in milder-sloped mainland environments. Relatively little research has been done in these environments, constituting a significant knowledge gap. To compound this uncertainty, little observational data are available in many island environments. As a result, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) currently lacks operational surge and inundation guidance for these regions. An exception to this general data scarcity is Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), which frequently experience strong tropical and extra-tropical storms resulting in high waves, storm surge, and river flooding. A large number of observational instruments have been deployed here, many by IOOS Caribbean Regional Association partners, creating a valuable resource for the evaluation and advancement of operational wave/surge/inundation models of these areas.</p><p>Three teams – an operational assessment team (federal user group), a numerical modeling team and a data management team – will work together to understand the driving processes of sea level variability in deep ocean island geographies, understand the robustness and accuracy of a variety of wind products, and to discern the ability to forecast tides, storm events and intra-annual variability.</p><p>Specifically in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September of 2017, detailed hindcasts were performed of these storm events using a high fidelity research grade ADCIRC+SWAN model of the Caribbean and Puerto Rico / U.S. Virgin Islands (PR/USVI), NOAA’s ADCIRC-driven HSOFS operational mesh, and NOAA NHC’s SLOSH using the latest PR/USVI grid. Furthermore, the impact of baroclinic processes on intra-annual and storm driven sea level variability is evaluated. The results from these studies are described in a sequence of two Journal of Geophysical Research papers (REF here; in review).</p><p>In addition, two sets of ancillary simulation sets were also developed as a result of the work and developments made in this project. The first are detailed analyses and hindcasts of Hurricanes Georges (1998) and Irene (2011). Unfortunately, the lack of highly reliable hindcast winds and/or water level data for these storms did not make for sufficiently reliable hindcasts to draw conclusions about the storm physics and/or model inter-comparisons. In addition, a statistical response probability set was developed with the SLOSH PR/USVI model.</p>"

Wave-current interaction created variations in the surge elevation in both space and time, with the more significant effects occurring over the shelf and open coast rather than inside the inner bays. Sea level change along the coast was mainly driven by barotropic dynamics; the highest vertically integrated water transports were essentially the same for cases with and without vertical stratification. However, wave-current interaction generated strong vertical current shear in some of the stratified areas, leading to a strong offshore transport near the bottom and vertical turbulent mixing over the continental shelf. Stratification could also result in a significant difference in current velocities around islands where the water is not vertically well-mixed.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Yunfang Sun, Changsheng Chen, Robert C.

All three models showed comparable tidal accuracy and consistent dynamic responses to storm winds, both with and without the inclusion of wave effects. The three models also showed that wave-current interaction could (1) change the current direction on the shelf to the north of Scituate Harbor from along-shelf to onshore, thereby enlarging onshore water transport and (2) intensify an anticyclonic eddy in the harbor entrance and a cyclonic eddy in the harbor interior, which could push water inside the harbor toward the northern peninsula and the southern end and thus enhance flooding in those areas.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Changsheng Chen, Robert C.

In all simulations, a wind driven coastal current flowed southward across the harbor entrance, with an attached separation eddy forming downstream of the northern breakwater and a rapid decrease of wave energy entering the harbor. With wave-current interaction, the southward coastal current was strongly enhanced and currents within the separation eddy increased to more than 1 m/s, making it highly nonlinear with large lateral shears. Comparisons of the model water elevation time series with harbor tide station measurements showed that wave-current interaction increased the peak model surge by ∼8 cm, in closer agreement with the observed peak.

The default/recommended setting for the wind input parameterization overestimated the maximum significant wave heights by about 2 m in the deep Gulf of Mexico when compared with observations from moorings. The overestimation could be relieved either by adjusting the maximum value of the surface drag coefficient or by substituting a high-wind-speed bulk formula for the default low-to-moderate one used in SWAN. Because of the dissipative effects of the shallow coastal areas, the overestimation of waves in deep water has limited impact on the waves in near-shore waters. Thus, previous wave model results using a low-to-moderate wind speed bulk formula may still be reliable in waters shallower than 20 m while overestimating significant wave heights in deeper waters for high wind speed conditions such as hurricanes.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Huang, Y., R.H.

However, its large wind field in conjunction with the broad Louisiana-Texas shelf and large-scale concave coastal geometry generated waves and surge that impacted over 1000 km of coastline. Ike's complex and varied wave and surge response included: the development of a storm surge “forerunner” 24 h prior to the storm's landfall due to strong shore-parallel, wind-driven currents and the associated across-shelf, geostrophic setup; the resulting early rise of water in coastal bays and lakes facilitating inland surge penetration and inundation; the shore-normal wind-driven peak surge; the southward propagation of a free wave along the Texas shelf; and the appearance of resonant and reflected waves on the adjacent continental shelf. Preexisting and rapidly deployed instrumentation provided the most comprehensive hurricane response data set ever recorded. More than 91 wave parameter time histories, 523 water level time histories, and 206 high water marks were collected in deep water, in the near shore, and up to 65km inland.

Grid resolution requirements were found to be less stringent in the open ocean, however, coarse resolution or the absence of intratidal zones decreased solution accuracy along protected near shore and inland coastal areas due to decreased frictional attenuation. Diurnal tidal amplitudes were more sensitive to the presence of intratidal zones and coarse mesh resolution than semidiurnal tides. The bottom friction parameterization had little effect on tidal skill, however, it had a significant impact on the strength of the alongshore current generated during hurricane Ike and the magnitude of the resulting geostrophic setup (forerunner). Nonlinear advection increased the geostrophic set up by 15–20 cm and increased resonant shelf waves by 20–30 cm.

In addition, NWS's official operational forecast storm surge model, SLOSH, was used on both local (Galveston and Sabine Pass basins) and Gulf of Mexico (ETSS) grids. The three unstructured models yielded similar results for both hurricanes. These models all appeared to reproduce the important physical processes, showed minimal water level or wave height bias, and comparable variances versus observations. SLOSH using the Galveston Basin grid failed to capture the hurricane Ike forerunner and was therefore biased significantly low. SLOSH performed better on the Sabine Pass Basin grid for hurricane Rita, which did not elicit a significant forerunner. SLOSH on the ETSS grid showed minimal bias for either storm, although its accuracy was limited by the nearly 5 km resolution in near shore/onshore areas. In all cases, SLOSH deviations from observations were greater than those from the three unstructured grid models. The largest difference in model performance was observed in execution speed and scalability. The implicit time stepping scheme of SELFE+WWM performed well at small numbers of cores, but scaled poorly at larger numbers of cores. ADCIRC+SWAN had better scaling and absolute performance when more than 128 cores were used per run. SLOSH is not configured to utilize modern parallel computing architecture and rather is limited to running on a single core. Runtimes for ADCIRC on a single core were more than 10 times longer than for SLOSH on the ETSS grid, even after the SLOSH runtimes were normalize for the number of grid nodes. Thus, SLOSH remains more efficient for use in probabilistic forecasting based on large ensembles of model runs. However, SLOSH-based probabilistic forecasts should be assessed for accuracy (particularly high or low bias) by comparing select, individual SLOSH runs with similar runs using higher resolution unstructured grid models as presented herein.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Kerr, P.
